This is a simple day planner to help schedule and keep track of different tasks throughout the day, during work hours (0900 to 1700).
It is colour coded to help easily identify which tasks are of immediate concern, following the system described below. The tasks are then stored
in localStorage, so that they can checked later in the day as well.

Colour guide:
  - Grey - Task has passed
  - Red - Tasks scheduled for current hour
  - Green - Tasks scheduled for future times
